      <p class="opening-para">My thoughts on our core learnings.</p>
      <p>
        Three things I have learned about myself: I am more capable of learning that I thought, and learning again has helped my brain feel sharper and happier. I'm quite comfortable sharing anything about myself with others â€“ I'm really starting to expect my own level of non-judgementallness of others, and am making up words in the meantime. I've come to realise that, although I likely do naturally recognise and appreciate EQ qualities in myself and others, it is such an important aspect of self to keep improving and applying to daily life in all areas.

        The roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in programming are to humanise and maintain positive, fun relationships in a very technical world, and to nurture the creativity and problem-solving aspects needed. To have empathy and recognise the values of those around us, we can create a more inclusive environment, resulting in happier and more constructive teamwork. Who doesn't feel happier when we feel recognised and appreciated by others?

        What has surprised me most is just how important core learning is for our development (ha). The topic of mindset really spoke to me, and encouraged me to take a really honest look at how I approach and think about things. I don't think anybody would like to admit to having a fixed mindset but there are definitely areas where mine hasn't been as focussed on growth as it could be.

        The most challenging aspects of core learning lean in to the above. Taking an honest look at yourself. It can feel a little uncomfortable to learn that there are sides to you that are hindering you in any way, whether it's your own personal progress, relationships, well-being. Coming back to the uncomfortable feeling that I've mentioned a few times these last few weeks, it seems to be something that you need to embrace as part of growth.

        I see the high focus on core learning being vital in developing our interpersonal skills for an industry with a diverse range of people in a very technical environment. Considering the collaborative nature of web development, an appreciation and respect for what one-another can bring results in a far more productivity and positivity. This collaboration has to get pretty tough at times when projects build in complexity and difficulty, so a recognition of the well-being and support of others surely needs to grow with this. I know from experience that keeping happy and positive reflects directly on your work, especially where there is any creativity involved.
