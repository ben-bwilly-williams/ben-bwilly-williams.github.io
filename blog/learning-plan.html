      <hr>
      <p class="opening-para">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p>My long-term goal is to develop a diverse new skillset, opening up my options to give me a happy and exciting future. I would like for this to build on my career as a designer and to see how this can all pair up, although I'd like to not necessarily restrict myself to any particular path.</p>
      <p>I may potentially have a front-end role in my old team at the University of Otago to go to, which is very exciting but also scary considering I can't do it yet!</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</p>
      <p>A learning strength that I believe I have is the ability to imprint key chunks of knowledge as I go. I really like to repeat back over points until I feel like I've made complete sense of them, and then put them in to real practice.</p>
      <p>A limitation that I can struggle with is the fear of breaking the ice with an entirely new subject. I've always been a little OCD with hobbies and interests and find it hard to let go of having to be good at things. I know I'll have to embrace being uncomfortable in not-knowing, and realise that's what it feels like to learn.</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
      <p>I'd quite like to see myself be able to open up a bit more and be comfortable sharing my work and knowledge. I've already had that uncomfortable feeling when sharing links to what I've done, going from feeling ok about my work to suddenly thinking 'oh no this is rubbish and everyone's going to think it's crap'.</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
      <p>I am dedicated to doing my best to keep up with the programme schedule, which will involve daily and weekly planning, and a willingness to commit and move forward â€“ even if I'm tempted to obsess and polish projects. I fully realise that between us all we will have the ability to overcome anything and everything, so to remember that reaching out and combining thoughts is the most powerful way to get over the hurdles. If/when things build up and get to me, I need to remind myself to take stock, breath, remember how far I've come and to not keep the problem to myself. I know that I'm always happy to help anyone and that others will be happy to help me.</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
      <p>Similar to above, I need to remember to not keep struggles to myself. After a period of trying to work something out, the group is there and will to help in the tech and core question channels. Also that the facilitators are there. I also have my brother who works in tech who is really keen to help me out where he can, and is even willing to have a look at some of my work.</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</p>
      <p>As I have already seen from the Facilitation team, they are a comforting and informative presence, many of whom have recently been in my position. I suppose the best that I can expect the facilitators to do is to point us in the right direction, be there to help if we need and to let us know if we need to get back on track in any way.</p>
      
      <p class="opening-para">7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
      <p>Lunch, dinner, sleep and occasional mountain biking. So nothing really.</p>
