      <p class="opening-para">IQ – arguably a measure of one's relative intelligence.<br>EQ – the ability to assess and manage emotion in oneself or others.</p>
      <p>As opposed to IQ, EQ isn't really quantifiable. It feels a little abstract, but the measured affect of one's EQ will be their ability to recognise, understand and therefore manage the emotions that they experience in daily life. This isn't to say these emotions should be stifled, but rather be viewed objectively and respected. The affects of improving EQ can lead to more healthy relationships with others and with oneself, amongst other benefits such as more balanced communication and the ability to better understand what's going on with others.</p>
